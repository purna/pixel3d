## 🌟 Features

### 🎨 3D Scene Creation
- **Professional 3D Modeling**: Create complex 3D scenes directly in your browser
- **Primitive Shapes**: Comprehensive set of 3D primitives (Box, Sphere, Cone, Cylinder, Plane, Torus, Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron, Torus Knot)
- **Advanced Lighting**: Multiple light types including Point, Spot, Directional, Ambient, and Hemisphere lighting
- **Real-time Rendering**: Powered by Three.js with high-performance WebGL rendering

### 🤖 AI-Powered Scene Generation
- **Magic Scene Generator**: Describe your scene in natural language and let AI create it
- **Gemini Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent scene generation
- **Smart Object Placement**: AI automatically positions and colors objects based on your description

### 👥 Character Animation
- **Animated Characters**: Support for Xbot (female) and Ybot (male) characters
- **GLTF Support**: Full compatibility with GLTF 3D models
- **Animation Blending**: Smooth transitions between idle, walk, and run animations
- **Real-time Animation**: Character animations update in real-time

### 🎞️ Animation System
- **Keyframe Animations**: Create smooth animations for any object in the scene
- **Timeline Interface**: Visual timeline for editing keyframes and animation curves
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, stop, loop, and speed controls
- **Easing Functions**: Multiple easing options for natural motion

- **Materials System**: Comprehensive material editor with color management
- **History Management**: Full undo/redo functionality for all actions

### 📸 Export & Production
- **JavaScript Export (.js)**: Export scenes as standalone JavaScript functions re-creatable in any Three.js project
- **Named `initSceneN` Functions**: Each exported scene is wrapped in a `window.initScene1(group)` call; call `window.initAllScenes(group)` to apply all at once
- **Material Name Preservation**: Named materials resolve through `mesh.material.name → userData.materialName → semantic hex-name` so `const matWood`, `const matDark`, etc. appear in the generated output
- **High-Resolution PNG Export**: Export scenes as PNG with customizable resolution
- **Multiple Resolutions**: Preset sizes from 24×24 game icons up to 4K (3840×2160)
- **Custom Resolutions**: Set any width and height for exports
- **Camera Border Preview**: Draggable overlay preview of the export frame
- **Transparent Background**: Optional checkbox for compositing exports

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings
- **Grid & Axes**: Toggle grid and axes helpers for precise positioning
- **Snap to Grid**: Optional grid snapping for accurate placement
- **Camera Controls**: Adjustable camera speed and movement sensitivity
- **Autosave**: Automatic scene saving with customizable intervals
- **Performance Tuning**: High-performance WebGL settings optimized for smooth rendering

### 💾 File Management
- **Browser Storage**: Save scenes directly to your browser
- **JSON Import/Export**: Full scene serialization and loading with `materialName` round-trip
- **GLB Export**: Binary GLTF model export compatible with major 3D tools
- **JavaScript Export (.js)**: Export scenes as `window.initSceneN` functions for use in external code

![Export Process](./demos/export-process.gif)
*[Replace with demo video showing the export process]*

1. Open the Scene Export section in the right panel
2. Configure export settings:
   - Canvas size (width/height)
   - Show/Hide camera border
   - Background transparency
3. Click "Export as PNG" to save your scene
4. Choose from preset resolutions or set custom dimensions

### JavaScript Export (.js)

Generate a self-contained script that re-creates your scene inside any Three.js app:

```js
// Inside your own Three.js app, create a Three.Group and pass it to the function:
window.initScene1(group);      // add the first scene to group
window.initAllScenes(group);   // add ALL scenes sequentially

// Example:
const group = new THREE.Group();
scene.add(group);
window.initAllScenes(group);
```

Each exported file contains one `window.initSceneN` function per named group and a master `window.initAllScenes` that calls them in order — materials are declared inside each function so they are local and never leak into yours:

```js
// Scene 1 — Ship (downloads as scene.js)
window.initScene1 = function(group) {
    const matWood = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0x8b5e2f, transparent: true, opacity: 0 });
    const matDark = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0x5c3a1a, transparent: true, opacity: 0 });

    const keel = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxGeometry(18, 0.5, 0.5), matDark);
    keel.position.set(0, 2, 0);
    group.add(keel);
};
```

#### Material Name Preservation
The exported function names are resolved from three sources, in priority order:
1. **`mesh.material.name`** — set by MaterialsManager → `Apply to Selected`
2. **`mesh.userData.materialName`** — written at shape creation and during JSON load
3. **`semanticColorName(hex_int)`** — built-in hex lookup (e.g. `0x8B5E2F` → `matWood`, `0x5C3A1A` → `matDark`)

JSON import/export also persists `materialName` so round-tripping keeps your material names intact.
